Nature’s silent symphony.
---

**Aria** is an ambient sound app.

Built from scratch using [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform), **Aria** is designed to flow across platforms. From Linux to Windows, from web to Android, while honoring the quiet beauty of the original [Blanket app](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/blanket), built by Rafael Mardojai for the GNOME desktop.

---

## 🌺 Goal of this project:

**Aria’s mission is simple:**  
To bring peace, calm, and ambient beauty to more people, on more platforms. Blanket is currently only available for Linux, and I wanted to bring it to the rest of the world.

This isn’t a fork or a reimplementation. It’s a handcrafted tribute.

A quiet attempt to capture the essence of **Blanket**, but retold with different tools, for different platforms, and with a different heartbeat (mine).

---

## 🌼 Features

**Everything that Blanket already bring to us:** 
- A curated library of ambient nature sounds: rain, fire, birds, forest, and more
- Per-sound volume sliders + master volume control

**But Aria brings this too:**
- Built-in timer to gently fade out after a chosen duration (perfect for sleep)
- Runs on Desktop (Linux, Windows, macOS, all via JVM), Android and Web (WASM/JS)

## Known limitations
#### 1. The Desktop version only supports WAV audio format.
I did try my best, but I couldn't find an audio library that supported OGG format AND be fast as hell (or well, fast enough to not freeze the UI. I'm still a totally beginner in coroutines and async programming, so it was very hard for me to find a solution).
#### 2. The Desktop version have a delay on changing the volume
It happen both on individual sounds and the master volume. I can't figure out why... is it a limitation of javax.sample?

## 🎒 What I have learned so far from this project
1. I'm still a beginner in Compose Multiplatform, not to say in Kotlin. It's such a difficult language...
